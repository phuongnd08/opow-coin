The coin I dream off: Bitcoin with native lightning support and no smart
contract. It's just money, pure money.

So list of its characteristics:

1. POW. I don't think there is another fundamentally correct validation process beside
   POW
2. Having every 6 months. Totally mined in 3 years. In 3 years miner
   should started earning with transaction fees alone.
2. 2 minutes block. Don't waste time of new users. Continuously
   adjustment of difficulty in real time, not 2 weeks.
3. Maintaining a payment channel should be extremely efficient. User can add more fund
   to channel at will.
4. Anti-cheat. Cheater get penalized with all the fund in channel go
   to the counter party
5. Multisig n-of-m is by design, using Schnorr
6. The reference implementation writen in Ruby.
